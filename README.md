about portfolio contact
To start out I used the 2.3 video to help get a layout, then I researched and bootstraped a similar contact page and used the parts I needed and changed the theme to my own preference.
I then copied the layout to the about page and the portfolio page.
I went through and linked the pages.
I am unsatisfied with the Portfolio page but that is something I will work on ongoingly.
I will be making notes in README as I go from now on!
